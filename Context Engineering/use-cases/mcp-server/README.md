# MCP Server Builder - Context Engineering Use Case

This use case demonstrates how to use **Context Engineering** and the **PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) process** to build production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It provides a proven template and workflow for creating MCP servers with GitHub OAuth authentication, database integration, and Cloudflare Workers deployment.

> A PRP is PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook—the minimum viable packet an AI needs to plausibly ship production-ready code on the first pass.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- GitHub account for OAuth
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)

### Step 1: Setup Your Project

```bash
# Clone the context engineering repository
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/Context-Engineering-Intro.git
cd Context-Engineering-Intro/use-cases/mcp-server

# Copy template to your new project directory
python copy_template.py my-mcp-server-project

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-mcp-server-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Wrangler CLI globally
npm install -g wrangler

# Authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

**What copy_template.py does:**
- Copies all template files except build artifacts (respects .gitignore)
- Renames README.md to README_TEMPLATE.md (so you can create your own README)
- Includes all source code, examples, tests, and configuration files
- Preserves the complete context engineering setup

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This use case teaches you how to:

- **Use the PRP process** to systematically build complex MCP servers
- **Leverage specialized context engineering** for MCP development
- **Follow proven patterns** from a production-ready MCP server template
- **Implement secure authentication** with GitHub OAuth and role-based access
- **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers** with monitoring and error handling

## 📋 How It Works - The PRP Process for MCP Servers

> **Step 1 is the Quick Start setup above** - clone repo, copy template, install dependencies, setup Wrangler

### Step 2: Define Your MCP Server

Edit `PRPs/INITIAL.md` to describe your specific MCP server requirements:

```markdown
## FEATURE:
We want to create a weather MCP server that provides real-time weather data
with caching and rate limiting.

## ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap API
- Redis caching for performance
- Rate limiting per user
- Historical weather data access
- Location search and autocomplete

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- API key management for external services
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Coordinate validation for location queries
```

### Step 3: Generate Your PRP

Use the specialized MCP PRP command to create a comprehensive implementation plan:

```bash
/prp-mcp-create INITIAL.md
```

**What this does:**
- Reads your feature request
- Researches the existing MCP codebase patterns
- Studies authentication and database integration patterns
- Creates a comprehensive PRP in `PRPs/your-server-name.md`
- Includes all context, validation loops, and step-by-step tasks

> It's important after your PRP is generated to validate everything! With the PRP framework, you are meant to be a part of the process to ensure the quality of all context! An execution is only as good as your PRP. Use /prp-mcp-create as a solid starting point.

### Step 4: Execute Your PRP

Use the specialized MCP execution command to build your server:

```bash
/prp-mcp-execute PRPs/your-server-name.md
```

**What this does:**
- Loads the complete PRP with all context
- Creates a detailed implementation plan using TodoWrite
- Implements each component following proven patterns
- Runs comprehensive validation (TypeScript, tests, deployment)
- Ensures your MCP server works end-to-end

### Step 5: Configure Environment

```bash
# Create environment file
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# Edit .dev.vars with your credentials
# - GitHub OAuth app credentials
# - Database connection string
# - Cookie encryption key
```

### Step 6: Test and Deploy

```bash
# Test locally
wrangler dev --config <your wrangler config (.jsonc)>

# Test with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
# Connect to: http://localhost:8792/mcp

# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy
```

## 🏗️ MCP-Specific Context Engineering

This use case includes specialized context engineering components designed specifically for MCP server development:

### Specialized Slash Commands

Located in `.claude/commands/`:

- **`/prp-mcp-create`** - Generates PRPs specifically for MCP servers
- **`/prp-mcp-execute`** - Executes MCP PRPs with comprehensive validation

These are specialized versions of the generic commands in the root `.claude/commands/`, but tailored for MCP development patterns.

### Specialized PRP Template

The template `PRPs/templates/prp_mcp_base.md` includes:

- **MCP-specific patterns** for tool registration and authentication
- **Cloudflare Workers configuration** for deployment
- **GitHub OAuth integration** patterns
- **Database security** and SQL injection protection
- **Comprehensive validation loops** from TypeScript to production
